This document describes various ways of contributing to the CoEDL Knowledge Base (CoEDL-KB).

## Using Markdown

This is the easiest method, and no setup (i.e. steps in [Setup guide](/contribute/setup)). This does mean the CoEDL-KB may not be available offline.

## Using SourceTree + GitLab

This is the standard way. There are two purposes to requiring new posts/changes to post to be submitted via Git (through SourceTree, to GitLab): 

1. This gives new users practice with the Git version control system while generating widely-useful content (but inadvertent actions do not affect their data).
2. Using GitLab's pipelines allow the website to be automatically re-generated when changes are received.

### Migrating content

If you already have content created locally or for elsewhere, and would like to have it added to the CoEDL-KB, get in contact with one of the admins and we'll be able to help you prepare it for this site.
